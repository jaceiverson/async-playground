learning async with a few examples

## util.py
Wrote a decorator that is way to over-engieered. It will work with async or non-async (standard) functions as well as uses <a href=https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>rich</a> for pretty optional outputs. It will also return the time if you want or just display it.
